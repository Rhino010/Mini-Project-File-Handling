Welcome to the Contact Manager:

Getting Started- Select the run button in your chosen IDE.

Using the application: 

The program will start off by showing a list of numbered options.

Type the number of the option you wish to utilize and then hit 'Enter'.

1. Add a Contact: This will prompt you to manually enter each category of the contacts Name, Phone Number, Email and Notes,
which is anything that you would like to remember about this account. After these will be stored in the progam.

2. Edit existing contact: You can access this by typing '2' at the main menu and following the prompts. All accounts 
are referenced by the contacts email.

3. Delete Contact: This will ask for the email of the contact you would like to delete. Enter the email and be sure this is the
proper contact to delete. Note: If you have exported your contacts you can recover this by re importing the contacts.

4. Search for Contact: Enter the contacts email address, and this will return all available information on the contact.

5. Display All Contacts: Choosing this option will display all stored contacts in the program.

6. Export Contacts: Selecting this option will transfer all contacts to an accessible .txt file. This can help recover contacts
that may have been accidentally overwritten or deleted.

7. Import Contacts: This option will take all contacts stored in the .txt file and import them to overwrite the contacts in the
Contact-Management-System program. These are not changed until the contacts are exported again.

8. This will quit the program and return you to the terminal access line.

Thank you for choosing the Contact Management System and I hope you find this useful!
